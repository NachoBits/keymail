            <h4>Our Team.</h4>
            <p>KeyMail was started as a Hackathon project at Western Washington University by a group of people who believe that privacy should be for everyone. With companies like Facebook manipulating our newsfeeds for experiments and Google scanning our email to target ads at us, we believe privacy is more important than ever. </p>
            <p>Encryption might be hard, but KeyMail is easy.</p>
